# Generalization scope and scientific boundaries

## What is generalized

TRSO-v3 is dataset-name independent. It operates on the task loss and feature
layout supplied by the active experiment, with globally scale-normalized calibration, sparse capacity-relative allocation,
and a depth-aware global residual budget. It supports the repository's three task
families:

- single-label classification;
- multi-label classification;
- image regression, including multiple outputs.

It supports recognized CNN, ViT and Swin insertion contracts and conservative
generic fallbacks for Conv2d CNNs and pre-normalized token blocks. Token support
includes rectangular grids and multiple prefix tokens when grid metadata is
available.

Automatic calibration size, response grouping, and candidate-capacity budget
selection prevent the default proposal from being hard-coded for DTD,
ResNet-18, ViT-Tiny, 47 classes, or one loss scale.

## What is not claimed

No method can guarantee high accuracy for every dataset, task, architecture,
distribution shift, or training budget. V3 improves generality and removes known
structural disadvantages; it does not fabricate a universal accuracy guarantee.

Paper baselines are also not universal by definition. Conv-Adapter, RepAdapter,
contracts. The fair runner records incompatible pairs as explicit skips. It does
not distort those methods merely to fill every cell of a result table.

## Source of truth for an experiment

For each experiment, inspect:

```text
resolved_protocol.json
dataset_protocol.json
trso_calibration.json
*_compatibility.json
fairness_verification.json
```

These artifacts state the resolved task, input size, optimizer/scheduler,
calibration size, parameter budget, insertion points, selected ranks, metrics,
and any compatibility skips.
